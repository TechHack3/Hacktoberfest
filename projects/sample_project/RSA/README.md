## Introduction

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that enables secure communication through encryption and decryption processes. This Java program demonstrates RSA encryption and decryption, allowing users to encrypt messages using a private key and decrypt messages using a public key.

## Features

- Generate RSA key pairs.
- Encrypt plain text messages using the private key.
- Decrypt encrypted messages using the public key.
- View generated RSA key pairs (public and private keys).
- Store and retrieve encrypted messages in/from a file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of RSA encryption and decryption.

## Security Considerations

Please note that while this code provides a basic understanding of RSA cryptography, it lacks several crucial security features required for production-level applications:

- **Error Handling**: The code does not robustly handle errors, including input validation and cryptographic exceptions.
- **Secure Key Storage**: In a real-world scenario, RSA keys must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Random Number Generation**: The quality of random number generation affects the security of cryptographic operations.
- **Key Management**: Proper key management practices involve rotation, backup, and protection of keys.
- **Cryptographic Padding**: The code does not employ padding schemes, which are essential to prevent attacks like padding oracle attacks.

For production applications, consult cryptographic experts, libraries, and frameworks to implement secure encryption and decryption processes.
